# Whaller Client SDK

## üìå Introduction

This project is a Python SDK for interacting with the [Whaller API](https://developer.whaller.com/).

This library is in the early stages of implementation and contains only a few endpoints, but you can easily extend it by following the do. We encourage you to work with the Whaller teams on extending it.

## üì¶ Installation

```sh
pip install whaller-client
```

## üöÄ Try the examples

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Set environment variables**

Before running examples scripts, you must create a `env.py` file with the following content as indicated in the `env.orig.py` file at the root of the examples folder:

```python
BASE_URL = "https://my.whaller.com"
CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
CLIENT_TOKEN = "your_client_token"
LOGIN = "your_email"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not have client_id and client_token, please contact contact@whaller.com. Please note that there is a charge for obtaining these credentials.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run an authentication example**

An authentication example script is available in `examples/`. To run it:

```sh
cd examples/
python example_auth.py
```

If authentication is successful, you will see:

```sh
Authentication successful.
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Use the SDK in your project**

Minimal usage example:

```python
from whaller_client.client import Client
from whaller_client.endpoints.persons import Persons

# Initialize the client
client = Client(BASE_URL, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_TOKEN)
client.set_credentials(LOGIN, PASSWORD)
client.authenticate()

# Example usage of endpoints
persons = Persons(client)
print(persons.get_notifications(LOGIN))
```
